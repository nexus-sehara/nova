## 3. Example Dashboard Layout

| Section                        | Example Metrics/Charts                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Overview**                   | Total recommendations, conversion rate, revenue       |
| **Top Products**               | Table: Product, Views, Recs Shown, Recs Bought        |
| **Top Categories/Brands**      | Table/Chart: Category, Recs Shown, Recs Bought        |
| **Recommendation Performance** | Chart: Recs shown vs. clicked vs. bought              |
| **Recent Activity**            | Feed: "User X bought Product Y via recommendation"    |
| **Settings**                   | Toggle: Enable/disable types of recommendations       |

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Backend
- Write SQL/Prisma queries to aggregate stats from the database.
- Expose API endpoints for the admin UI:
  - `/api/admin/stats/overview`
  - `/api/admin/stats/top-products`
  - `/api/admin/stats/recommendation-performance`
  - `/api/admin/stats/recent-activity`

### Frontend (Admin UI)
- Use Shopify Polaris for a native look.
- Fetch stats from backend and display as cards, tables, and charts (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts).

### Metrics to Track in DB
- For every recommendation shown, log: `recommendationId`, `productId`, `userId/sessionId`, `shownAt`
- For every recommendation clicked/added to cart/purchased, log: `recommendationId`, `action` (clicked, added, bought), `timestamp`
- For every product, track: `views`, `addsToCart`, `purchases`, `recommendationsShown`, `recommendationsBought`

---

## 5. Next Steps
1. Decide on MVP dashboard metrics (from above).
2. Design API endpoints and DB queries needed.
3. Sketch UI layout (Polaris cards, tables, charts).
4. Build and iterate!
